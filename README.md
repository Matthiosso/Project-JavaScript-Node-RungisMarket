### About the program
This project is a simulation of a merchandise consumption system between the Rungis Market, restaurants and clients. Every clients are created to go to eat in any restaurant available and with the stock of food required.

### How to launch it
To launch the program, you will need the librairies '**chalk**'(to display with colors) and '**events**'(to create and handle events).

### Elements used
We used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to execute the program, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)  to check the syntax mistakes, [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) from Jetbrains as an IDE, and finally [GitHub](https://github.com/) (and gitignore) to share the project between us.
